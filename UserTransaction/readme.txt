2. Export the project as a .war file to Tomcat installation folder specifically into webapps folder
3. Run Tomcat
4. Run TestData.java file as a java application in Eclipse IDE

Feature would like to add in the future
1. Security checking whether data format inputted is correct 
	for example:
	Currency code, would be great to have a list of currency code it can check against
2. Different kind of testing (using other programming language to test)
